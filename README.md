# myriad

## @kjhealy

Adapts the Roboto themes in https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes/ to make two Myriad Pro-based themes, `theme_myriad()` and `theme_myriad_semi()` for ggplot. Note that this repo does not include the Myriad font files (the `.otf` files), which are owned by Adobe. You may already have them installed on your computer, or they may have come bundled with your copy of Acrobat Reader or other Adobe software.
